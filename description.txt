Andarc is an arcade shooting game which is designed to be extremely hard. 
The aim of the game is to avoid obstacle collision and shoot the enemy squares. 
To control the movement of the shooter, tap the right half of the screen whereas 
tap the left half of the screen to shoot the squares that  fall from the top. 
Apart from the squares, there are the rectangle barriers that fall occasionally. 
The shooter dies and the game gets over if he collides with either the squares 
or the bigger rectangle barriers. Every second of the game, the gamer’s score is
 incremented by 10 and for killing each of the squares, the score is incremented 
by 100. The background changes when the difficulty increases at each level. The 
local highscores are saved so that you can flaunt it to your friends.
